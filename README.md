# Predefined Filters

Widget allows you to specify xpath queries in the model and then display buttons in the UI mapped to each of those queries.

## Typical usage scenario

Useful for when you're currently using tabs to show Data Grids with different filters i.e. (My Tasks, My Open Tasks, All Tasks)
